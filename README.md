# README
This project was my first foray into Machine Learning. A binary classification algorithm using linear regression.

The program will learn for 5000 iterations by default, and then render images on the screen along with outputs to console stating the neural network's answer and the actual answer for the given image. Upon closing an image, it will move on to the next one, and so on. The program can be exited using a keyboard interrupt (CTRL-C) in the terminal window.
